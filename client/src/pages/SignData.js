      description: "This hand sign, where the index and middle fingers are extended in a 'V' shape, is commonly used in American Sign Language (ASL) to represent the number '2.' It is created by raising the index and middle fingers while the thumb and remaining fingers are folded into the palm. Beyond ASL, the 'V' sign has broader meanings in various cultures. It is widely known as a symbol for 'peace,' especially when the palm faces outward, and was popularized during anti-war movements. It is also known as the 'victory' sign, often used to signify success or triumph when the palm faces inward. The cultural context and orientation of the hand can influence the specific meaning, so it is important to be aware of its interpretation in different settings.",
